NHS Hack Day Cardiff
==========================

This repository contains source code for our implementation of eye tracking on a tablet using OpenCV. This was the winning entry for NHSHackday (Jan 2014) in Cardiff that spanned for two days. This application is aimed at kids for use in hospitals. 

There is a vital part of this application missing, which are the Cardiff Cards assets. We could not include them for copyright reasons, so the build will fail quoting `Asset Catalogue Compiler Error` due to this.
